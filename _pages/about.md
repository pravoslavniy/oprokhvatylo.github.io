Hi, im Oleksandr and im 24 years old. 
I have Master's degree in applied physics (Kyiv National University of Taras Shevchenko) Faculty of Radiophysics, Electronics and Computer Systems (c)2015-2020.
Ambitious and organized person who never stops learning. I am not afraid
of difficulties. A non-conflict person who communicates well in a team,
competently performs the necessary tasks. I am a versatile person who
wants to develop in different ways.

These words are written in my resume. 

But the same words can be written in different ways. If you dive deeper - since childhood I have been fascinated by exact sciences and art, therefore my skills in graphic and motion design, as I have always been creative, marketing, system administration. For the last few years I have been fascinated by the crypto world, to date there is no way without this knowledge. First experience was in the ambassador program at the Forma—Åar company. I do graphic content, correspond with members.  I love working with people, whether it's face-to-face, behind the monitor screen, or in chat. Therefore, if you need a person who will interact, encourage participants and give only positive emotions - nice to meet you
